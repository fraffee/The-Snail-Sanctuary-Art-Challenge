# 🌿 The Snail Sanctuary

A cozy, minimalist web application where hand-painted snails wander a garden. 

## 🐌 Setup Instructions

### 1. Your Assets
For the app to look right, ensure you have the following files in this root folder:
- `background.png`: Your garden floor image.
- `snail_1.png` through `snail_5.png`: Your roaming snail characters.
- `card_1.png` through `card_5.png`: Your art challenge images.

### 2. How it Works
- **Movement**: Snails move randomly and rotate to face their direction.
- **Social Distancing**: Snails have a "Snail Brain" that senses nearby friends and steers them away to prevent overlapping.
- **Interaction**: Click any snail to pause it and reveal its hidden art card.
- **Ambience**: Toggle the sound icon in the bottom left for garden sounds.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **React**: UI Logic.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling.
- **Lucide React**: Minimalist Icons.
- **Vanilla Physics**: Custom separation and wandering algorithms.

## 🚀 Deployment
This project is designed to be hosted easily on **GitHub Pages** or **Replit**. Just ensure all `.tsx` and `.ts` files are in their correct folders.
